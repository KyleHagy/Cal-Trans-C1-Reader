Thanks for getting back to us. Let me know if you have any further questions.












I just want to thank you a lot for being so helpful. Yes that is my mistake I sent the wrong version of the part.

“PPTC122LFBN-RC “ is the correct part number for - Location 'J3, J7, MFG P/N

For U6, U19, U7, U20 MFG P/N: Yes, we did not want locking clips. The correct version of that part should be “SSM-119-L-SV” Here are the links to the part.

For U8, U16 I also noticed that the MFG P/N part we sent you uses locking clips, the correct part should be “SSM-108-L-SV” Here is the link to the part.
