First PCB was produced is from the 1/15/2020 design and had several errors. 

These issues and errors were addressed and fixed in the new 3/30/2020 design. 

The 1/15/2020 schematic can be used as the "3/30/2020 schematic" because no errors/changes were in the schematic, the errors only existed in the PCB layout.

Please use the 3/30/2020 design for any future fabrications.
